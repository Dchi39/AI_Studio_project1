**🔍 Project Description: Geemini 2.0 Object Identification Projects**

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on object identification using Geemini 2.0, specifically leveraging the gemini-2.0-flash model in AI Studio. These projects demonstrate real-time object recognition, classification, and orientation analysis, ideal for embedded vision applications and intelligent automation systems.

The **gemini-2.0-flash** model is optimized for high-speed inference on edge devices, offering accurate and efficient visual understanding capabilities. Within this repository, you will find use cases such as:

-Defect detection by comparing test images with reference images

-Object orientation analysis for industrial parts

-Real-time visual inspection systems

Each project showcases the integration of Geemini 2.0 with hardware setups and includes sample data, model configurations, and implementation details to help you replicate or adapt the solutions for your own applications.

**🔑Before you begin**
📝You need a Gemini API key. If you don't already have one, you can get it for free in Google AI Studio.

📦Using Python 3.9+, install the google-genai package using the following pip command:

pip install -q -U google-genai

**📝Basic Structure to make your first API request**

from google import genai

client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    contents="Explain how AI works in a few words",
)

print(response.text)
